# C - Structures, Typedef

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the use of structures and `typedef` in C programming. The tasks involve creating and manipulating custom data types for a dog structure, showcasing the versatility and functionality of structures and typedefs in organizing complex data.

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Tasks

- `0-poppy.c`: Defines a new type `struct dog`.
- `1-init_dog.c`: Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
- `2-print_dog.c`: Function that prints a `struct dog`.
- `3-dog_t.c`: Define a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`.
- `4-new_dog.c`: Function that creates a new dog.
- `5-free_dog.c`: Function that frees dogs.
