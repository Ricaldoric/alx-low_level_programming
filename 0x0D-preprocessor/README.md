# C Preprocessor Projects

## Description

This repository contains various tasks related to the C language preprocessor. The projects focus on the use of macros, both object-like and function-like, and other preprocessor directives in C programming. The tasks are implemented following strict coding standards and compiled with specific flags to ensure code quality and efficiency.

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Files

Each task in this project is contained in its header file:

- `0-object_like_macro.h`: Defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
- `1-pi.h`: Defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
- `2-main.c`: A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.
- `3-function_like_macro.h`: A function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number x.
- `4-sum.h`: A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
