# More malloc, free

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Programme. The main objective is to learn about dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and memory deallocation using `free` in C programming. The project includes tasks that require the use of `malloc` to allocate memory for various data types, handling of memory allocation failures, and the use of `free` to deallocate memory.

## Files

Below is a list of files and a brief description of what each file does:

- `0-malloc_checked.c`: A function that allocates memory using `malloc`.
- `1-string_nconcat.c`: A function that concatenates two strings.
- `2-calloc.c`: A custom implementation of the `calloc` function.
- `3-array_range.c`: A function that creates an array of integers.
- `100-realloc.c`: A custom implementation of the `realloc` function.
- `101-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two positive numbers.
- `main.h`: Header file containing all the function prototypes used in the project.

## Compilation

Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

Example of compiling the files:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o program_name
