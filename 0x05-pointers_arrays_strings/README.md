## Project Tasks

1. **98 Battery st.**  
   - Description: Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
   - Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

2. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**  
   - Description: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
   - Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

3. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**  
   - Description: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
   - Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`

4. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**  
   - Description: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
   - Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`

5. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**  
   - Description: Write a function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.
   - Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`

6. **A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**  
   - Description: Write a function that reverses a string.
   - Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s);`

7. **Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**  
   - Description: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
   - Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);`

8. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**  
   - Description: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
   - Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str);`

9. **Arrays are not pointers**  
   - Description: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
   - Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`

10. **strcpy**  
    - Description: Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
    - Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`

11. **Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**  
    - Description: Write a function that converts a string to an integer.
    - Prototype: `int _atoi(char *s);`

12. **Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**  
    - Description: Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.
