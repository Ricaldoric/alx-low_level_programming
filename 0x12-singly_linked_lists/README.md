# Singly Linked Lists Project

## Description
This project involves implementing various functions to manipulate singly linked lists in C. These include operations like adding a node, removing a node, and printing the elements of a list.

## Requirements
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files end with a new line.
- Code uses the Betty style.
- No use of global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Allowed functions: `malloc`, `free`, `exit`. Use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden except where explicitly allowed.
- You can use `_putchar`.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## File Descriptions
- `lists.h`: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used by the project.
- `0-print_list.c`: Function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
