# Memory Allocation in C

This project consists of several tasks aimed at understanding and implementing dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`.

## Description

Dynamic memory allocation is a technique in C that allows you to allocate memory during runtime. In this project, we explore this concept by implementing various functions that perform tasks such as creating arrays, duplicating strings, and concatenating strings.

## Files

- `0-create_array.c`: Creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- `1-strdup.c`: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- `2-str_concat.c`: Concatenates two strings.
- `main.h`: Header file containing prototypes of all functions used in this project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Compilation

All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Usage

To use the functions implemented in this project, you need to include the `main.h` header file in your source file and call the required function.

```c
