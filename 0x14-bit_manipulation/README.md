# Bit Manipulation in C

## Description
This project contains various tasks and examples demonstrating bit manipulation techniques in C programming. It covers operations like converting binary numbers to unsigned integers, printing binary representations, and manipulating individual bits in a number.

## Files
Each task in this project is represented by a separate C file:

- `0-binary_to_uint.c`: Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- `1-print_binary.c`: Prints the binary representation of a number.
- ... (and so on for each task)

## Requirements
- GCC compiler with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style and documentation standards.

## Usage
Each file can be compiled individually along with the `main.h` header and tested with a `main.c` file.
